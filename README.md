# PAM-StarterKit
This project will help you start your Privleged Account Management journey with some Groups and Roles that can then be applied in Active Directory to secure your Deployment.  This will have groups for User Rights Assignments, Security Options along with just core sample Delegated Permission Groups too.  This is great for Labs to test these settings out but also help you deploy these same settings in production once you are ready too.
